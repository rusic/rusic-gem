    Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag
    clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian
    child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical
    helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what
    you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because
    you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.

    Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's
    called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows,
    and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make
    more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
    don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
