  pages/about.html.liquid

  This template is a custom page. It has all the same liquid functionality of
  the other templates but you can create as many of them as you want. They're
  great for things like "about us", "terms & conditions" or "privacy policy".

  The contents of this template are rendered where `content_for_layout` is
  called within layouts/subdomain.html.liquid. See http://developer.rusic.com/
  for more details.
